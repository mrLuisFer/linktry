# About Api

the api folder works as if its name says it an api that gives us information that we can use in different components to show information

It is adapted to be as reusable as possible considering that different properties can be added which we can use.

Obviously this can be improved and made more scalable, but we must check that it works correctly in case there is a change

And if you are going to use it, don't worry, just change the information to yours and let the rest do their magic :D
